- 👋 Hello! I'm Jacob Sulahian, a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Engineering with a focus on embedded systems, firmware development, and hardware engineering.
- 🌐 I’m interested in designing and optimizing digital circuits, developing microcontroller-based systems, and solving real-world challenges in embedded technology and hardware.
- 📚 I’m currently working on embedded C projects. I will be learning Python, VHDL, Verilog, C++, and Linux to further expand my skill set and prepare for future projects.
- 🌲 Beyond engineering, you’ll find me exploring computer architecture, delving into philosophy, reading books, staying active with fitness and outdoor adventures, and building connections through professional networking.
